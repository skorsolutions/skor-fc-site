## v51.40 — Create announcements from scheduled games

- Each scheduled game now includes a **Create Announcement** action.
- The action opens the existing announcement editor and prefills the match type, current publish date, matchup, kickoff, arrival time, location, home/away status, and the reminder to bring both kits.
- The message ends with an **Additional notes** area and remains fully editable before publication.
- Creating the draft does not publish anything; the captain must still review it and press **Publish Announcement**.
- The scheduled match's saved arrival time is used when available, with the existing 45-minute fallback otherwise.
- **SQL needed:** No.
- **Database changes performed:** None.
- Affected file: `admin.html`.

## v51.39 — Reorder substitution waves

- Every first-half and second-half substitution wave now has **↑ Up** and **↓ Down** controls.
- Captains can add a new wave at the end and move it between existing waves.
- Reordering stays within the selected half and immediately renumbers all waves.
- The **Bench after this wave** calculations and lineup export order update immediately after a move.
- First and last waves disable unavailable move directions.
- Existing saved lineup data remains compatible because waves were already stored as ordered arrays.
- **SQL needed:** No.
- **Database changes performed:** None.
- Affected file: `admin.html`.

## v51.38 — Show every substitution wave on export

- The lineup image export no longer limits each half to four substitution waves.
- Every first-half wave is rendered in full; every second-half wave is also rendered when second-half export visibility is enabled.
- The substitutions card and total image height now grow dynamically so additional waves do not overlap the quote or gameplan notes.
- The previous `+ N more ... planned` summary is removed.
- The existing second-half export visibility toggle is preserved.
- **SQL needed:** No.
- **Database changes performed:** None.
- Affected file: `admin.html`.

## v51.37 — Overwrite same-name lineup variations

- Saving a lineup now updates the newest existing variation when the selected game and trimmed lineup name match.
- Name matching is case-insensitive, so `Balanced` and `balanced` are treated as the same lineup within one game.
- The same lineup name can still exist independently under different games.
- The rule applies to both **Save Variation** and **Copy Current to Game**.
- Existing historical duplicate rows are preserved; this change prevents new duplicates during normal captain saves.
- No Supabase schema, policy, or direct data changes were made.
- Affected file: `admin.html`.

## v51.36 — Bench tracker beneath substitution waves

- Each planned substitution wave now shows a compact **Bench after this wave** panel directly beneath it.
- The bench is calculated cumulatively: players entering are removed from the bench, players leaving are added, and each later wave starts from the prior wave's result.
- Second-half wave calculations continue from the completed first-half plan.
- Bench chips include the same player labels and jersey numbers used elsewhere in the lineup builder.
- This is a lineup-planning UI change only; no Supabase schema or saved-state changes are required.
- Affected file: `admin.html`.

## v51.35 — Restore Potential Positions in saved lineups

- The Potential Positions panel now redraws immediately after a player is assigned or moved on the formation board.
- Existing saved lineups with empty Potential Positions are automatically backfilled from their named field-slot assignments when loaded.
- Backfill merges with manually entered Potential Positions and prevents duplicate player entries.
- Freeform lineups remain unchanged because they do not have named formation slots to infer.
- Affected file: `admin.html`.

## v51.34 — Auto-fill Potential Positions

- Assigning a player to a named formation slot now immediately adds that player to the matching row in **Potential Positions**.
- Automatic additions are deduplicated. Reassigning a player to the same slot does not create duplicate entries.
- Moving a player to another field position adds the new potential position without removing previously recorded positions.
- Occupied field slots retain their tactical label (for example, `LB`, `CAM`, or `ST`) so the position remains visible beside the player.
- Freeform placement is unchanged because the custom board does not use named formation slots.
- Affected file: `admin.html`.
