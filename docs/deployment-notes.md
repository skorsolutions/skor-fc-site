## v51.34 — Auto-fill Potential Positions

- Assigning a player to a named formation slot now immediately adds that player to the matching row in **Potential Positions**.
- Automatic additions are deduplicated. Reassigning a player to the same slot does not create duplicate entries.
- Moving a player to another field position adds the new potential position without removing previously recorded positions.
- Occupied field slots retain their tactical label (for example, `LB`, `CAM`, or `ST`) so the position remains visible beside the player.
- Freeform placement is unchanged because the custom board does not use named formation slots.
- Affected file: `admin.html`.
